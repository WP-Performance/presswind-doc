# All the styles files

The starter theme use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Main file is style.css.
If you add files, don't forget to add the import in the main file :

```css
/** DEFAULT FOR EXAMPLE */
@import './default.css';
```

## Editor CSS

The main file for Gutenberg editor is ```editor.css```.

All declarations in this file, will be apply in gutenberg editor.

This file isn't loaded in front.

## Configuration

The main config is in the file ```tailwind.config.js```

To avoid a complete reset of the style from theme.json, the TailwindCSS "preflight" on front is disabled with:

```js
const usePreflightFront = false
```

This setting can be confusing sometime with TailwindCSS value like ```content``` or ```border```.

::alert{type="info"}
You can activate the "preflight" if you want. But when you use "preflight", you'll lost the settings for font size, etc. defined in the ```theme.json```

## Palette in TailwindCSS

The theme use [@_tw/themejson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@_tw/themejson)

The palettes in theme.json are availables in TailwindCSS (with classes like bg-primary or text-primary), and the values for contentSize and wideSize are available for setting max-width with either max-w-content or max-w-wide.
